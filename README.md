# Linear Regression:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linear Regression is a Statistical model used to predict the relation between independent and dependent variables.

### Regression Equation:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simplest form of a simple linear regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is presented by:

<div align="center"> Y = mX + C </div>

_Where,_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Y = Dependent variable_  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _X = Independent variable_  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _m = Slop of the line_  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _C = Coefficient of the line_  <br />
